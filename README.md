project:STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
    ### Objective
The objective of this grade tracker project is to provide users (such as students or teachers) with a simple tool to enter, track, and analyze grades for different subjects. By calculating the average grade, letter grade, and GPA, the program allows users to assess academic performance at a glance.

### Key Activities
1. **Data Entry**: Users input each subject and its corresponding grade. The program validates the entries to ensure they are valid numbers.
2. **Calculation**:
   - Calculates the average of all entered grades.
   - Determines the letter grade based on the average.
   - Converts the letter grade to a GPA score.
3. **Summary Generation**: The program generates a summary of all entered subjects with their grades, followed by the overall average, letter grade, and GPA.
4. **Interactive User Experience**: The program continuously prompts for subjects and grades until the user signals they are done.

### Technology Used
- **Python Programming Language**: Used for all aspects of the project, including logic implementation, user interaction, and output display.
- **Standard Python Libraries**: The program uses Python's built-in functions (e.g., `input`, `print`, `try-except` for error handling, and dictionary operations) to create an interactive console application without needing additional libraries.
